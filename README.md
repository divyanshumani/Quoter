# Quoter
An automatic random quote generator with onload()

Created this because I couldn't find something similar anywhere.
Most of the quote generators required a button with on.click to call the js function to change the quote

This piece of code will keep on shuffling the quotes from the inventory after a fixed duration without any human interference.

You can choose to seed the <script> part into a seperate js file. Since I didn't have many js elements, I kept the whole function in <script> to demonstrate fluency.
